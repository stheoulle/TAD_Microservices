= Logging and Query Tracing System

== System and Technical Components

To effectively trace logs and queries, implement the following components:

1. *Logging Framework*: Use a logging framework like winston in Adonis to log events, errors, and other relevant information. 

2. *Centralized Log Management*: Use Loki with Grafana to aggregate and visualize logs from different services. Loki is a horizontally scalable, highly available, multi-tenant log aggregation system.

3. *Distributed Tracing*: Implement distributed tracing with Tempo to trace requests as they flow through different services. Tempo is a highly scalable and efficient tracing backend.

4. *API Gateway*: Acts as an entry point for all client requests and can log request/response data.

5. *Monitoring Tools*: Use Grafana with Mimir for monitoring and visualizing system metrics. Mimir is a scalable, multi-tenant time series database that integrates seamlessly with Grafana.

6. *Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)*: Integrate with a SIEM system for security-based logs and incident response.

== Security-Based Logs for Managed SOC

To integrate with a managed Security Operations Center (SOC), consider the following needs:

1. *Comprehensive Logging*
   - **Objective**: Capture all security-relevant events to provide a complete audit trail.
   - **Implementation**:
     - **Authentication Attempts**: Log both successful and failed login attempts, including details like user ID, timestamp, and IP address.
     - **Authorization Failures**: Record instances where users attempt to access resources they are not authorized to view.
     - **Data Access Events**: Log access to sensitive data, including who accessed it, when, and from where.
     - **System Changes**: Track changes to system configurations, user permissions, and other critical settings.

2. *Real-time Monitoring*
   - **Objective**: Detect and respond to security incidents as they occur.
   - **Implementation**:
     - **Monitoring Tools**: Use tools that provide real-time visibility into security events and anomalies.
     - **Alerting**: Set up alerts for suspicious activities, such as multiple failed login attempts or unusual data access patterns.
     - **Automated Responses**: Implement automated responses to common threats, such as blocking IP addresses after multiple failed login attempts.

3. *Compliance*
   - **Objective**: Ensure that logging practices comply with relevant regulations and standards.
   - **Implementation**:
     - **GDPR**: Ensure that logs containing personal data are handled in compliance with GDPR requirements, including data minimization and anonymization.

4. *Incident Response*
   - **Objective**: Define and implement procedures for responding to security incidents.
   - **Implementation**:
     - **Incident Response Plan**: Develop a plan that outlines the steps to take in response to different types of security incidents.
     - **Log Analysis**: Include procedures for analyzing logs to identify the root cause of incidents.
     - **Forensic Investigation**: Ensure that logs are preserved and available for forensic analysis.

5. *Integration with SIEM*
   - **Objective**: Use a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system to correlate logs from various sources and detect potential security threats.
   - **Implementation**:
     - **Log Aggregation**: Collect logs from all relevant sources, including applications, servers, and network devices.
     - **Correlation Rules**: Define rules to correlate events across different logs and identify potential security threats.
     - **Threat Detection**: Use the SIEM system to detect and alert on known threat patterns and anomalies.

6. *Access Control*
   - **Objective**: Implement strict access controls to protect log data from unauthorized access.
   - **Implementation**:
     - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Define roles and permissions to control access to log data.
     - **Encryption**: Encrypt log data both at rest and in transit to protect it from unauthorized access.
     - **Audit Access**: Regularly audit access to log data to ensure compliance with access control policies.

=== Benefits

- **Operational Visibility**: Comprehensive logging and real-time monitoring provide visibility into security events, enabling proactive threat detection and response.
- **Incident Response**: Defined incident response procedures and integration with SIEM systems enable quick and effective response to security incidents.
- **Access Control**: Strict access controls protect log data from unauthorized access, maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of security-relevant information.
