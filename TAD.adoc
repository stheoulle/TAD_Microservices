== Assumptions

We are looking to migrate BEEP to a microservices architecture.

The specifications are the same as described during all previous iterations of BEEP.

I will answer 10 questions:

- Via the redaction of the TAD (components architecture, sequences diagram, deployment architecture, etc.)
- Via the production of POCs (when mentioned)
- Using draw.io
- Redaction using AsciiDoc

Prohibited technologies:

- Message queue
- CQRS
- Event Sourcing


== Q1: Functional Neighborhoods and Microservices

- Define functionalities in user story format
- Organize into functional neighborhoods
- Propose an architecture diagram

== Q2: Authentication System with OIDC

- Architecture diagram
- Deployment diagram
- Sequence diagrams for user account actions
- Constraints: Use Keycloak, support Polytech LDAP and Google account linking
- POC: Modify Beep, provide deployment guide and source code

== Q3: Inter-Microservices Communication

- Approach explanation
- Sequence diagram of service communication
- POC: HelloWorld microservices communication

== Q4: Authorization System Implementation

- Define authorization service
- Technical and functional architecture
- Sequence diagrams for key actions
- Managing permissions at various levels

== Q5: Logs and Query Tracing

- Define system and technical components
- Deployment diagram
- Sequence diagram for query tracing
- Security-based logs for SOC integration

== Q6: Production-Ready System

- Data security, backup, and restore
- Observability and service supervision
- High availability and continuity plans
- Detailed diagrams

== Q7: Infrastructure Security NO

- Mobile application integration (BFF model)
- Security zones and network separation (DMZ, etc.)
- Cryptography, certificates, and protocol choices

== Q8: Search Engine Integration

- Functional and technical proposal
- Full-text indexing approach
- UI mockup of the search feature
- Technical stack and indexing sequence diagram

== Q9: Platform Security Management NO

- Security analysis for network and microservices
- Communication security between microservices
- Security proposal with sequence diagrams
- POC: Securing HelloWorld microservices

== Q10: UI Application Integration

- Microservice integration for a seamless UX
- Example: Video streaming integration
- Necessary diagrams
- POC: Replacing Beep conference app with microservices-based QCM

== Timeline

- *3 February*: Goals announcement
- *5 March*: Draft report submission (30-50% answers, diagrams, and images)
- *30 March*: Complete V0 file (100% answers, 80% diagrams, 50-70% POCs)
- *30 May 23:42*: Final submission of Git repository containing:
  - AsciiDoc file
  - Images (PNG + Draw.io sources)
  - Production URLs for POCs and repositories

== Goals Announcement

The goal is to implement a microservices architecture for the application.

- The monolith is too big and needs to be split.
- New technical layers are required for maintainability and smooth operation.
- Choose 8 out of the 10 questions (bonus for covering all).
- *Mandatory questions*: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

== Additional Considerations

- DAT vs. DAA complementarity discussion
- Documentation iteration process: initial deployment, real-world constraints, on-premise vs. cloud iterations
- Levels of DAT documentation (light, advanced, very detailed)
