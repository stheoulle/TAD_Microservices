== Q2: How do I manage the authentication system with an OIDC?

== What is OpenID?

OpenID is a protocol that allows for the verification of user identities based on authentication performed by an Authorization Server and obtains user profile information in an interoperable and REST-like manner.

=== How does OpenID Connect work?

OpenID Connect enables an Internet identity ecosystem. It follows these steps:

1. The User navigates to a website via a web browser.
2. The User clicks sign-in and types their username and password.
3. The RP (Client) sends an authentication request to the OpenID Provider (OP).
4. The OP authenticates the User and obtains authorization.
5. The OP sends an Identity Token to the RP and usually an Access Token.
6. The RP can send a request with the Access Token to the User device.
7. The UserInfo Endpoint returns Claims about the End-User.

=== What are the benefits of OpenID Connect?

- Simplified User Authentication
- Secure User Authentication
- Single Sign-On (SSO)
- User Profile Information
- Standardized
- Interoperable
- REST-like

=== What are the components of OpenID Connect?

- **End-User**: The person who uses the RP.
- **RP (Relying Party)**: The application that wants to authenticate the End-User.
- **OP (OpenID Provider)**: The service that authenticates the End-User and provides Claims to the RP.
- **Authorization Server**: The server that authenticates the End-User and issues Access Tokens.
- **Identity Token**: A JWT that contains information about the End-User.

== What is Keycloak?

Keycloak is an open-source Identity and Access Management solution that makes it easy to secure applications and services with little to no code.

https://www.keycloak.org/server/containers 

=== How does Keycloak work?

Keycloak works by providing an authentication server that can be used to secure applications and services. It supports OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, and SAML 2.0 protocols, making it easy to integrate with existing systems.

Keycloak provides a wide range of features, including:

- User Authentication
- User Registration
- User Management
- Role-Based Access Control
- Single Sign-On
- Multi-Factor Authentication
- Social Login
- User Sessions
- Account Management
- Admin Console
- REST API
- Scalability

=== What are the main components of Keycloak?

Keycloak has two main components, including:

- **Keycloak Server**: The server that provides the authentication and authorization services. It includes the API and a graphical interface.
- **Keycloak Client**: The client that interacts with the Keycloak server to authenticate users and obtain tokens.

== How to integrate Keycloak with an OIDC?

To integrate Keycloak with an OIDC, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Create a Realm**: Create a new realm in Keycloak to manage the authentication and authorization settings for the application.
2. **Create a Client**: Create a new client in the realm to represent the application.
3. **Configure the Client**: Configure the client settings, such as the client ID, client secret, and redirect URIs.
4. **Integrate the Client**: Integrate the client with the application by adding the necessary code to handle the authentication flow.
5. **Test the Integration**: Test the integration by logging in to the application and verifying that the authentication works as expected.

== How to secure an application with Keycloak?

To secure an application with Keycloak, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Add Keycloak Dependencies**: Add the Keycloak dependencies to the application, such as the Keycloak adapter.
2. **Configure Keycloak Adapter**: Configure the Keycloak adapter in the application to connect to the Keycloak server.
3. **Secure Endpoints**: Secure the application endpoints by adding Keycloak security constraints.
4. **Add Keycloak Login Page**: Add the Keycloak login page to the application to handle the authentication flow.

== Architecture Diagram

=== Identifying the components:
- **Client (Frontend)**: User interface (web or mobile).
- **Application Server (Backend)**: Business logic and API.
- **Keycloak Server**: Authentication and authorization server.
- **Database**: Storage for user and application data.
- **External Services**: Google OAuth, Polytech LDAP.

=== Define the interactions:
- Authentication flow between the client, application server, and Keycloak.
- Integration with Google OAuth and Polytech LDAP for authentication.
- Communication between the application server and the database.

== Deployment Diagram

=== Identifying the infrastructure:
- Physical or virtual servers.
- Cloud services (AWS, Azure, GCP).
- Containers (Docker, Kubernetes).

=== Define the topology:
- Placement of components on servers/containers.
- Network configuration (load balancers, firewalls).

== POC (Proof of Concept)

== OpenID Connect (OIDC)

OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an authentication protocol built on top of the OAuth 2.0 framework. It provides a standardized method for verifying the identity of users and obtaining basic profile information in a secure and interoperable manner.

=== Key Features

- **Identity Verification**: OIDC allows applications to verify the identity of users based on authentication performed by an Authorization Server. This is done using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), which contain claims about the user's identity.

- **Interoperability**: OIDC is designed to work across different platforms and devices, making it a versatile solution for modern applications. It supports a wide range of clients, including web applications, mobile apps, and JavaScript applications.

- **Security and Privacy**: OIDC enhances security by removing the need for applications to manage user passwords. Instead, it relies on tokens issued by an Identity Provider (IdP), which can be easily revoked or refreshed.

- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: OIDC supports SSO, allowing users to authenticate once and gain access to multiple applications without needing to log in again. This improves user experience and reduces the administrative burden of managing multiple credentials.

- **Standardization**: OIDC is a standard protocol maintained by the OpenID Foundation, ensuring compatibility and ease of integration with various systems and services.

=== How It Works

1. **Authentication Request**: A client application (Relying Party) initiates an authentication request to the OpenID Provider (OP).

2. **User Authentication**: The OP authenticates the user and obtains their consent to share specific information with the client application.

3. **Token Issuance**: Upon successful authentication, the OP issues tokens to the client application. These tokens include an ID token, which contains user identity information, and optionally an access token for API access.

4. **Identity Verification**: The client application uses the ID token to verify the user's identity and can use the access token to access protected resources on behalf of the user.

=== Benefits

- **Simplified Integration**: OIDC simplifies the integration of authentication and authorization in applications, reducing development time and effort.

- **Enhanced Security**: By relying on tokens instead of passwords, OIDC reduces the risk of credential-based data breaches.

- **User Consent**: OIDC includes built-in user consent mechanisms, ensuring that users have control over their personal data.

=== Conclusion

OpenID Connect is a powerful and flexible authentication protocol that enhances security, interoperability, and user experience in modern applications. Its adoption by major technology companies and its standardization make it a reliable choice for identity management in various scenarios.
