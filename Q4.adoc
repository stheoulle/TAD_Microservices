= Authorization System Overview

An authorization system determines whether a user has permission to perform specific actions or access certain resources within an application. It is a critical component of security, ensuring that users can only access data and functionality appropriate to their roles and permissions.

== Authorization Service Definition

An authorization service is responsible for managing and enforcing access control policies. It verifies user permissions based on roles, groups, or other attributes and grants or denies access to resources accordingly.

== Technical and Functional Architecture

=== Technical Architecture

1. **Microservices Architecture**:
   - *Authorization Service*: Centralized service responsible for managing permissions and roles.
   - *User Service*: Manages user data and authentication.
   - *Resource Services*: Individual microservices for servers, categories and channels, each communicating with the Authorization Service to enforce access control.

2. **Database**:
   - Use a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) to store user roles, permissions, and access control lists (ACLs).

3. **API Gateway**:
   - Acts as a single entry point for all client requests, routing them to the appropriate microservice and handling authentication and authorization checks.

4. **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**:
   - Used for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. It can be signed using a secret or a public/private key pair.

5. **OAuth 2.0**:
   - An authorization framework that enables applications to obtain limited access to user accounts on an HTTP service.

6. **Caching**:
   - Use a caching layer (e.g., Redis) to store frequently accessed permissions data to improve performance.

=== Functional Architecture

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
   - Define roles (e.g., admin, moderator, user) with associated permissions.
   - Assign roles to users or groups of users.

2. **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**:
   - Define permissions at a granular level (e.g., server, category, channel).
   - Allow or deny access based on user roles and ACLs.

3. **Global Permissions**:
   - Define global permissions for platform administrators, allowing them to manage all resources across the platform.
