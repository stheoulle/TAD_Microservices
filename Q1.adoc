= Proposed Architecture Diagram

The architecture diagram represents these microservices as distinct components, each responsible for a specific set of functionalities. Each service communicates with others through well-defined APIs, ensuring loose coupling and high cohesion. This architecture promotes scalability, maintainability, and independent deployment of each service.

== Key Considerations

- *Single Responsibility Principle*: Each microservice should focus on a single responsibility, ensuring that it does one thing well.
- *Cohesion*: Related functionalities should be grouped together within the same microservice.
- *Loosely Coupled*: Minimize dependencies between microservices to reduce the impact of changes.
- *Scalability*: Ensure that each microservice can scale independently based on demand.
- *Resilience*: Design the system to handle failures in individual microservices without affecting the entire application.
